# KubeClipper Governance

## 1. Governance Model

KubeClipper adopts an open, meritocratic governance model inspired by CNCF and Kubernetes community best practices. The project is led by a group of Maintainers, with contributions and reviews from a broader set of Contributors and Reviewers.

- **Maintainers**: Responsible for overall project direction, releases, and final decision-making.
- **Reviewers**: Experienced contributors who review code, documentation, and participate in discussions.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits issues, pull requests, or documentation.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers
- Approve and merge pull requests.
- Set project direction and roadmap.
- Ensure project health and community engagement.
- Nominate and vote on new maintainers.

### Reviewers
- Review pull requests and provide feedback.
- Help triage issues and participate in discussions.

### Contributors
- Submit issues, pull requests, and documentation.
- Participate in discussions and code reviews.

## 3. Maintainers and Reviewers

The current list of maintainers and reviewers is maintained in the [OWNERS](OWNERS) file(s) in the repository. Each subdirectory may have its own OWNERS file for module-specific governance.

## 4. Decision Making Process

- **Minor changes**: Lazy consensus among maintainers and reviewers. If no objections are raised within 72 hours, the change is accepted.
- **Major changes**: Require a simple majority vote among maintainers. Major changes include project direction, governance changes, and breaking changes.
- **Voting**: Each maintainer has one vote. Votes are cast via GitHub comments or in project meetings (if any).

## 5. Becoming a Maintainer

To become a maintainer, a contributor should:
- Demonstrate a history of substantial contributions (code, documentation, reviews) over at least 3 months.
- Be nominated by an existing maintainer.
- Receive approval by a majority of current maintainers.

## 6. Removing a Maintainer

A maintainer may be removed if they:
- Voluntarily step down.
- Are inactive for more than 6 months (no code reviews, commits, or participation).
- Are removed by a majority vote of the other maintainers for reasons such as violation of the Code of Conduct.

## 7. Changing Governance

- Any change to this governance document requires a majority vote of the current maintainers.
- Proposed changes should be submitted as a pull request and discussed openly.

## 8. Communication

- Most discussions happen via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- For real-time or synchronous communication, refer to the [Community](https://github.com/kubeclipper/community) page.

## 9. Code of Conduct

KubeClipper follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to foster a welcoming and respectful community.
